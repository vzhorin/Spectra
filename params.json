{"name":"Spectra","tagline":"SPECTRA: high precision computational spectroscopy","body":"# SPECTRA \r\nis a program for high precision paramagnetic ions energy levels calculations based on  crystal field multipole method (CFMM) and the method of irreducible tensor operators. It allows to calculate the electronic structure of all elements with unfilled  f-shells, including lanthanides and actinides in crystalline hosts and nano-structures. It can be used in scientific research, educational institutions, industry (laser materials, chemical analysis etc).  \r\n\r\nCreated by: V.V.Zhorin (1998)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
